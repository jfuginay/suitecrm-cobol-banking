  - Transaction Logs
  - Custom formats

**Key Files**:
- `Legacy_Bridge.php` - Main module class
- `views/view.import.php` - Import wizard UI
- `js/legacy_bridge.js` - Wizard logic
- `legacy-converter.cob` - COBOL conversion program

## Architecture Highlights

### COBOL-PHP Bridge
- RESTful API gateway (Node.js)
