# SuiteCRM + COBOL Integration for Regional Banks & Credit Unions
## Product Requirements Document

### Executive Summary
Transform SuiteCRM (1.8M lines of PHP legacy code) into the first CRM with native COBOL mainframe integration, targeting 6,000+ regional banks and credit unions that need to bridge their customer relationship management with core banking systems.

### Problem Statement
Regional financial institutions face a critical gap:
- **Frontend**: Modern CRM systems (SuiteCRM) for customer management
- **Backend**: COBOL mainframes processing $3 trillion daily
- **Gap**: No integration = manual data entry, errors, compliance risks

### Target User: Regional Bank IT Directors
**Profile**: 
- Managing 50-500 employee banks
- Running COBOL core banking systems (Fiserv, Jack Henry)
- Using or considering SuiteCRM for customer management
- Budget: $50K-200K for integration solutions

**Pain Points**:
1. Customer data in CRM doesn't match mainframe records
2. Loan officers can't see real-time account balances
3. Manual reconciliation takes 20+ hours/week
4. Compliance audits fail due to data mismatches

### Solution: SuiteCRM-COBOL Bridge
The first open-source CRM with native COBOL integration, enabling:
- Real-time mainframe data in CRM views
- COBOL-powered financial calculations
- Automated batch synchronization
- Legacy system authentication

## Six Modernization Features

### Feature 1: COBOL Calculation Engine
**Description**: Replace PHP financial math with COBOL precision
**Implementation**:
- COBOL microservice for interest, amortization, fees
- REST API wrapper (based on our payroll pattern)
- SuiteCRM module calling COBOL for all money math
**Business Value**: Eliminate penny rounding errors in loan calculations

### Feature 2: Mainframe Sync Module  
**Description**: Bi-directional sync between SuiteCRM and COBOL systems
**Implementation**:
- COBOL adapter for common banking cores (Fiserv DNA, Silverlake)
- Queue-based sync with retry logic
- Field mapping configuration UI
**Business Value**: Real-time account data without screen scraping

### Feature 3: Batch Report Generator
**Description**: COBOL-powered nightly reports and statements
**Implementation**:
- COBOL batch processor reading CRM data
- PDF generation for statements (like our payroll stubs)
- Schedule manager in SuiteCRM
**Business Value**: Pixel-perfect regulatory reports

### Feature 4: Legacy Authentication Bridge
**Description**: Single sign-on between CRM and mainframe
**Implementation**:
- COBOL LDAP/RACF integration
- Session management across systems
- Audit trail for compliance
**Business Value**: One login for tellers, reduce security risks

### Feature 5: Transaction Ledger View
**Description**: Display COBOL transactions inside CRM
**Implementation**:
- Real-time COBOL transaction feed
- SuiteCRM dashlet for account history
- Transaction search and filtering
**Business Value**: Complete customer view without mainframe access

### Feature 6: COBOL Workflow Engine
**Description**: Business rules matching mainframe logic
**Implementation**:
- COBOL decision engine for approvals
- Workflow designer UI in SuiteCRM
- Parallel processing with mainframe
**Business Value**: Consistent decisions across all systems

## Technical Architecture

### Modernization Approach
1. **Preserve**: Keep SuiteCRM's proven CRM logic
2. **Enhance**: Add COBOL for financial precision
3. **Bridge**: Connect without replacing either system

### Technology Stack
- **CRM**: SuiteCRM 7.14 (PHP 8.1 upgrade)
- **COBOL**: GnuCOBOL with REST wrappers
- **Integration**: Node.js API gateway
- **Queue**: Redis for sync management
- **Deploy**: Docker + Kubernetes

### Data Flow
```
SuiteCRM UI → PHP Business Logic → API Gateway → COBOL Services → Mainframe
     ↑                                                                    ↓
     ←────────────────── Real-time Updates ─────────────────────────────←
```

## Success Metrics
- Process 10,000 transactions/second
- Sub-100ms calculation response time
- 99.99% sync accuracy
- Zero penny discrepancies
- 50% reduction in manual reconciliation

## 7-Day Implementation Plan

**Day 1-2**: Legacy System Mastery
- Clone and analyze SuiteCRM codebase
- Map financial calculation points
- Set up COBOL development environment
- Create integration architecture

**Day 3-4**: Core Integration
- Build COBOL calculation engine
- Create API gateway
- Implement basic mainframe sync
- Test with sample bank data

**Day 5-6**: Feature Completion
- Complete all 6 features
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Integration testing

**Day 7**: Polish & Demo
- Deploy to cloud
- Create bank-specific demo
- Documentation
- ROI calculator for banks

## Why This Wins
1. **Real Problem**: Every regional bank needs this
2. **Proven Market**: 6,000+ potential customers
3. **Technical Innovation**: First CRM+COBOL integration
4. **Clear ROI**: Save 20 hours/week = $50K/year
5. **Open Source**: Banks trust open source more

## Competitive Advantage
- Salesforce Financial Cloud: $500K+, no COBOL
- Microsoft Dynamics: $200K+, requires Azure
- **Our Solution**: $0 open source + $50K implementation

This positions SuiteCRM as the only CRM that truly understands banking infrastructure.
