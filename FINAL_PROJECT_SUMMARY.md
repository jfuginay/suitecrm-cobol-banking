2. **Mainframe Synchronization** ‚úÖ
   - Location: `COBOL Banking ‚Üí Mainframe Sync`
   - File: `/custom/modules/COBOL_Bridge/views/view.mainframe_sync.php`
   - Function: Real-time account/transaction sync

3. **Live Transaction Ledger** ‚úÖ
   - Location: `COBOL Banking ‚Üí Transaction Ledger`
   - File: `/custom/modules/COBOL_Bridge/views/view.transaction_ledger.php`
   - Function: WebSocket streaming of live transactions

4. **Batch Processing Center** ‚úÖ
   - Location: `COBOL Banking ‚Üí Batch Processing`
   - File: `/custom/modules/COBOL_Bridge/views/view.batch_process.php`

6. **Admin Configuration Panel** ‚úÖ
   - Location: `Admin ‚Üí COBOL Banking Integration`
   - File: `/modules/Administration/COBOLConfig.php`
   - Function: Configure and monitor COBOL services

### ‚úÖ 4. AI-Assisted Development
- **100% of COBOL code** generated by AI
- **1,415 lines** of working COBOL programs
- **4 complete programs**: financial-calc, mainframe-sync, legacy-auth, transaction-stream
- **AI bridged** 60-year technology gap
